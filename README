This repository contains the general LAMMPS codes used in our paper to simulate polymer glasses under steady and oscillatory shear conditions. It also contains the data files of the published figures in the Source_Data folder.


The list of scripts are:

01_PolGlass.in
02_SteadyShear.in
03_OscilatoryShear.in
04_PolGlass_Crack.in


For a rough idea of the time needed to replicate the results of our work:
simulations were performed on the Dutch national supercomputer Snellius, using a single node and roughly 12 to 24 tasks per node. 
Each simulation requires roughly an execution time of 50-70h spread between equilibration, production, and shear (either oscillatory or steady shear, leading to differences in total execution time).
